## 📦 Why
Managing workflows can be time consuming. Most managers find approving employee logs, times and pay a little more challenging to maintain over time. This solution is built to develop a web3 approach to a real world workflow problem. An idea inspired by <a href="https://github.com/usesource/">The Source Project</a> I was able to bring smart contract approval to a simple workflow environment. 

## 💅 Features

- 🚀 Dummy proof API for handling common workflows
- 🛡 Easily manage employee data
- 🚀 Equipped with an in memory on chain cryptographic verficiation system
- 🛡 Built-in protection for workflow duplication
- 🚀 Easy to set up and integrate
- 🛡 Written in Python, Javascript, and sprinkled with a little React


## 👨‍💻 Install

```bash
pipenv install .
```

```bash
cd main/static && npm install 
```

## 🔨 Usage

## On Chain Platform 
Ginop provides in memory blockchain for saftey and security. This decision is based on a cost effective approach to implementing smart contract verification.
